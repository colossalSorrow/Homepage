                    <p>
                        I was responsible for making a software including a database for the inventory in the lab and introducing Git to my department. <br>
                        It included writing instructions and documentation and also doing the initial population for product repositories in Git.<br><br>

                    <h2> Software development project in University	September –         December 2019</h2>
                        <p>We were assigned to create a strategy and develop software for an E-commerce platform complete with detailed documentation, <br>
                        use cases, narratives, etc. We were divdied into small teams and worked in iterations, constantly in touch with a hypothetical client. <br>
                        Aside from just the software devlopment, I got a taste of what working in a team is like and how parallel development takes place.
